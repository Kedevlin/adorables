# adorables

### The internet was made for cute animals. Adorables is a place to share all your favorite cute animal links with your friends. A link a day keeps the sad away!

- This application currently uses OAuth with Github (with the omniauth-github gem)
  - Please register your own application with Github and enter the Github Key and Github Secret in the .env file.
    - Don't push the .env file to github. Keep it secret, keep it safe.
    - The dotenv-rails gem manages loading environment variables from the .env for Omniauth in development, so no sweat!
  - Set your app callback to `http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback` for development.
